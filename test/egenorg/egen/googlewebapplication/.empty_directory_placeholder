GIT does not track empty directories. This file exists for the purpose of making
not empty the directory that contains it, so that the directory is created
whenever the GIT repository is cloned. This file may seem useless when the
directory that contains it contains some other files (either at the same level,
or in some descendant directory). However it is best to keep this file even if
there are other files in the directory, just in case a change causes the
directory to be empty again. In such a case, this file will ensure that the
directory still gets created.
